## 🚀 A Bit About Me
### 🌍 Background
I am a confident and hardworking individual with a proactive attitude and a strong commitment to learning and self-improvement. My professional experience spans various roles, including machine operation, retail management, and hospitality, where I developed skills such as adaptability, problem-solving, and effective communication. I thrive in both independent and team settings, taking initiative to ensure tasks are completed efficiently and to a high standard. 
### 🎓 Education
Most recently, I attended the University of Nottingham, where I completed a Foundation Year in Engineering and Physical Sciences. Prior to this, I attended [the King's (The Cathedral) School](https://www.kings.peterborough.sch.uk/), where I achieved A-Levels in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Physics, complemented by a strong track record in GCSEs. 
### 📘 Current Learning
I'm honing my skills in offensive and defensive cybersecurity through platforms like TryHackMe. Topics include SOC operations, reverse engineering, and threat analysis. In addition, I'm working on programming projects relating to cybersecurity to futher my understanding of the field.
## 🛠️ Technical Skills
### 💻 Languages
+ **Python** - I have been learning Python since secondary school, and in that time I have developed a deep understanding of the language.
+ **C** - I learned C during my first year of University, and picked it up quickly. It was an interesting and engaging experience to learn the intricacies of a lower level language.
+ **Arduino (C#)** - I learned the Arduino language both during my own time, where I made Electronics projects as a hobby, and during the first year of my Electrical and Electronic Engineering degree where I learned how to use technologies such as Computer Vision, Sonar and short range WiFi communication to control a robot.
+ **MATLAB** - I learned MATLAB during my foundation year. I learned how to manipulate data and create engaging graphs. For my end-of-year project I made a 2D simulation of a piston firing.
+ **Git** - I have recently been learning how to use CLI git, including pulling, pushing, making commits and source control as a concept.

In addition to these languages, I have a solid understanding of Flowcharts and Pseudocode, as well as the Software Development lifecycle as a whole.
### 🖥️ Operating Systems
+ **Windows** - I have a solid understanding of Windows, as it has been my OS of choice since I built my first computer in 2015. I am now learning more about the inner workings of Windows, such as Active Directory.
+ **Linux** - I have good knowledge of Linux, as I know it's the industry standard when it comes to Cybersecurity and Software Development. I have a good understanding of the BASH shell and filesystem. Over the years I have used various distributions including Ubuntu, Parrot, Kali, Debian, Raspbian, and Tails.

### 🛡️ Cybersecurity
I have been improving my knowledge of Cybersecurity through platforms such as TryHackMe. I have been learning about a diverse range of topics, from defensive techniques such as SOC, network scanning and reverse engineering, to offensive techniques such as SQL and script injection, hash cracking and finding and exploiting bugs. I have used tools including:
+ Nmap
+ Burp Suite
+ Aircrack-ng
+ Wifite
+ SQLMap
+ Metasploitable
+ JohnTheRipper
+ Hashcat
## 🌱 Interests & Hobbies
When I'm not coding or diving into cybersecurity challenges, you can find me:

+ Producing music on FL Studio! I'm a big fan of house, speed garage and bassline 🎵
+ Staying active by going to the gym, sparring at Muay Thai class or shooting some pucks 🥋⛸️
+ Going out and meeting up with friends, be it the pub, the club or a rave 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
